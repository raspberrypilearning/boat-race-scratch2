## Adding a timer

Now you will add a timer to your game, so that the player has to get to the island as quickly as possible.

--- task ---

Add a new variable called `time`{:class="blockdata"} to your Stage.

You can also choose a look for your timer by changing how your new variable is displayed.

Now add code blocks to your Stage so that the timer counts up until the boat reaches the island.

--- hints ---
--- hint ---
On the Stage, `when the green flag is clicked`{:class="blockcontrol"}, `set the time to 0`{:class="blockdata"}. Inside your `forever`{:class="blockcontrol"} loop, you'll need to first `wait 0.1 secs`{:class="blockcontrol"}, then `change the time by 0.1`{:class="blockdata"}.
--- /hint ---
--- hint ---
Here are the code blocks you'll need:
![stage](images/stage.png)
```blocks
change [time v] by (0.1)

when flag clicked

forever
end

wait (0.1) secs

set [time v] to [0]
```
--- /hint ---
--- hint ---
Here's what your new code should look like:
![stage](images/stage.png)
```blocks
when flag clicked
set [time v] to [0]
forever
wait (0.1) secs
change [time v] by (0.1)
end
```

Test out your game and see how quickly you can get the boat to the island!
